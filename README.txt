Step 1. Identify the no of chains in the protein and get the residue index of each chain (Changes to be made in the script if the no of chains is different in other proteins). Here no of chains = 5
Step 2. Identify the pair of chains in contact and make the residue index pairs accordingly (Changes in chain pairs to be made in the script according to the protein). Here the pairs are AB, BC, CD and DE.
Step 3. Run the script and get the average fibrillar deviation with standard deviation
